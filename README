GRead, a Google Application, by S.Angel / Twidi <s.angel@twidi.com>

GRead, in Python and QT, is created for Maemo but also works on my linux desktop.

It uses libgreader (see my fork : http://github.com/twidi/libgreader, forked from http://github.com/askedrelic/libgreader)

The main goal is to have a Google Reader application as good as the "Newsrob" one on Android i used before having my Nokia n900.

The first step is to create an application with the basics, as we have in the "grr" application for Maemo (https://garage.maemo.org/projects/grr/)

This firs step is currently done minus keybord shortcuts, but with many improvements:

- more settings (for interface)
- works too on 2G/3G (for me grr works only on wifi)
- auto-rotation
- thread for network operations
- manage auto-reconnect, detect lack of connectivity (all operations will be done when the network is available)
- allow to show original feed content in the application (using QTWebkit) or in the browser
- see more special feeds (shared and starred, but also "all", "friends", "notes"...)
- scroll long titles

There is some little bugs like unread count not always sync in feeds list when some item are read (without doing a resync)

To launch it, simply execute the gread.py file in the src directory
